# Spamdeck

#### I don't assume any action done by this app, except if it used friendly to spread love in Twitch's chats.

### What's Spamdeck ?
Spamdeck is an Android app inspired of the Elgato Streamdeck. I created this for viewers, to create macros for prefils and customisable messages. Because of my poor level for android, it may don't work propely on phones under 5 inches. It let you 40 buttons.

### What about the versions names ?
I name the versions of the app form names of streamers that I like. I try to sort them from "smaller" to "larger" streamers. They aren't afilliated with the app, it's just a tribute from my and only my will.
